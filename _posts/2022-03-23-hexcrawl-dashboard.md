[Rise Up Comus: Hexcrawl Dashboards](http://riseupcomus.blogspot.com/2022/03/hexcrawl-dashboards.html)
>I've put together a proof of concept for something I've been calling the Hexcrawl Dashboard: a patchwork of iFramed tools cobbled together onto a single site for ease of GM access. The gimmick is that you have a single page for your map, your encounters, your random encounters, your dungeons, your monster's stats - anything you need to reference during play.

More cool use of web pages for running games. We really like the hexes linking out to one page dungeons and the embedded random generators. This looks like a step towards a "[control panel](http://questingblog.com/control-panel-book-layout-osr/)" sort of tool, but taking advantage of the innate properties of the web.
