I am in the throes of a minor obsession with wrestling. Specifically, the idea of [kayfabe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe), and the weird, blurry relationship that modern wrestling has with fiction, reality, and suspension of disbelief. How storylines bleed beyond the ring and are acted out on social media and in “real-life,” and how a self-aware acknowledgement of that space between real and fake is a core part of the appeal. Also, the fandom is passionate and vocal (like, [this thread about The Golden Lovers](https://twitter.com/EffingBoring/status/967145669038260224) is fucking great and is largely responsible for my current interest), and [the slang is cool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms). I dunno how excited I am about the actual wrestling part. I guess [I’ll find out on the 14th of July](http://newcastleprowrestling.com.au/newypro70tickets).
