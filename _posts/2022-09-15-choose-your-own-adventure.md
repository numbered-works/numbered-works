[The Enduring Allure of Choose Your Own Adventure Books](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/19/the-enduring-allure-of-choose-your-own-adventure-books) by Leslie Jamison.

> The warning at the beginning of every Choose Your Own Adventure is also a promise: “You are responsible because *you* choose! . . . Think carefully before you make a move! One mistake may be your last.” It’s not just saying, *You are in control*, but also *You will find yourself in pleasurable danger.*
