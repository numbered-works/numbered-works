This [1983 PBS television program](https://youtu.be/H5cYCuiS-z4) (based on [David Macaulay's book of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_(book))), is a fascinating mix of history, fiction, animation, live action, and tweed blazers.

It also features Brian Blessed doing some wonderful voice acting in full Steven Toast mode. Recommended!
