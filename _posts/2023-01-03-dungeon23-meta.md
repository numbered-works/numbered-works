Some quick notes on our [#Dungeon23](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) process/tools:

* Working digitally. We love notebooks too but we always have phones in our pockets.
* Writing in markdown into two text files. One is a dump for random ideas in no particular order. The other is keyed room descriptions.
* Using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to make very rudimentary isometric reference images, then drawing in [Procreate](https://procreate.com/ipad) on an iPad.
* Syncing files with Github. Writing in Atom on the desktop and [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/) on iPhone and iPad.
* The idea is to write a room/space/object every day, draw a map over the course of the week, and put words and pictures up on the website every Sunday.
* No overarching structure or planning ahead. We'll see what emerges.
