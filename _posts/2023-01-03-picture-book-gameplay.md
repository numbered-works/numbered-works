[Picture Book Gameplay](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2023/01/picture-book-gameplay.html) by Dwiz.

> It's funny because reviewers actually talk a lot about including "practical visuals" in RPG products. But usually they mean things like diagrams, flowcharts, or a really well-rendered and readable map, with the key directly on it. I think everyone agrees that illustrations of characters, monsters, and hijinks are expected to just be flavor, right? But... if the best way to improve a map-based adventure is to put the map key directly next to (or within) the rooms on the illustration, then... what if you cut out the middle man and just draw the description?

Really enjoyed this post, and it's full of great example illustrations too.
