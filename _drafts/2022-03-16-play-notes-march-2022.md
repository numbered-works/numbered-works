This is our current ongoing play situation:

* A party consisting of three adult players, one five year old, and two eight year olds, exploring [the Forgotten Quag](), using [Big Bone]() rules (and yes, we do use [the recommended giant foam d12]()).
* A longer running [Maze Rats]() game for one adult and one eight year old. A meandering [hex crawl](), currently playing through [Gone-Fishin']() but with additional on-shore adventures as we make our way upriver. Our last session explored the [Temple of the Moon Priests]().
* Frequent one-shots for various combinations of children and adults using [one]() [page]() [dungeons]() and [Little Bones]().

We're not going to do full session notes here but instead share funny or interesting moments
