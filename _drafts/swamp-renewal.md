# Swamp Renewal

The adventurers are called upon to help protect a wizard's peat mining operation.

## THE SWAMP

Duckweed covers the surface of the water. The air is heavy. The sound of animal life is relentless. Chirps, calls, screams, hoots. Vague smell of farts.

### 1. First Island
* Rickety pier to the south.
* Piles of dried peat. The peat is formed into rough spheres, about the size of basket balls.
* Bridges to the north and east.

### 2. Wizard's domain
* What appears to be the first level of a wizard's tower.
