# Swamp Renewal

Version 0.1

The adventurers are called upon to help protect the construction site of a new wizard's tower.

## THE SWAMP
Duckweed covers the surface of the water, what lies below cannot be seen. The air is heavy. There is the relentless thrum of droning, chirping animal and insect sound, punctuated by calls, howls, hoots, and snarls. Trees and green mounds vibrate with the movement of small creatures. Smell of farts, wet earth. The party is on a filthy, mud-encrusted barge, captained by **Ervind Oblong**. They are approaching a cluster of islands.

### 1. First Island
* Rickety pier to the south.
* Ground is wet, muddy.
* Piles of dried peat sitting on grates made from sticks. The peat is formed into rough spheres, about the size of basket balls. Dried peat is transported downriver on the barge and sold at the nearest town.
* Bridges to the north and east.

### 2. Wizard's domain
* What appears to be the ground level of a wizard's tower. The next level is under construction, and various elements of the walls and windows are suspended in the air. An ornate rooftop hovers many metres above.
* Home to The Wizard Grezill Berch.

### 3. Peat Mine
* This island is devoid of trees. At the northern end of the island, a **Mud Golem** digs fistfuls of peat from the earth. It carries the peat south, across a rickety bridge to Island 1, where it stacks the peat to dry. It repeats this sequence all day.

### 4. New Mine
* At the south of the island a **Swamp Golem** pulls a tree out of the ground, carries it to the north of the island, and tosses it onto the dam structure. It repeats this sequence all day.

### 5. The Dam
* A wide, low pile of trees and scrub torn out of the ground and tossed here by the golem. Lets significant amounts of water through but is beginning to have a noticeable effect on the water level in the swamp.

### 6. Gas Harvester

### 7. The Forest

### 8. Druid's home
* Small mud hut, domed in shape. A chimney at the back spilling herbaceous smoke.
* Home to XXXXX, the frogfolk druid.

### 9. The Clearing


### 10. Forager's home
