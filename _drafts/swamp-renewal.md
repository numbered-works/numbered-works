# Swamp Renewal

Version 0.1

The adventurers are called upon to protect the construction site of a new wizard's tower.

## THE SWAMP
Duckweed covers the surface of the water. The air is heavy. There is the relentless thrum of droning, chirping animal and insect sound, punctuated by calls, howls, hoots, and snarls. Trees and leafy green mounds vibrate with the movements of unknown tiny creatures. All wooden structures are built from roughly hewn sticks, vines and logs. Smell of wet earth, farts.

The party is on a filthy, mud-encrusted peat barge, captained by bargeman **Ervind Oblong**. They are travelling upstream from the south, approaching a cluster of islands. The barge is propelled from underneath by a hidden **Stone Golem**, walking along the riverbed.

### 1. Swamp Port
* Rickety pier to the south.
* Ground is wet, muddy. Scattered foliage and trees.
* Piles of dried peat sitting on grates made from sticks and peat-blackened rope. The peat is formed into rough balls, about the size of watermelons. Dried peat is transported downriver on the barge and sold at the nearest town.
* Piles of new stone and stacks of lumber.
* Bridges to the north and east.

### 2. Wizard's domain
* Ground level of a wizard's tower. The next level is under construction, and various elements of the walls and windows are magically suspended in the air. An ornate rooftop hovers many metres above.
* Home to **The Wizard Grezill Berch**.
* Hammer, nails, rope, lumber.

### 3. Peat Mine
* This island is devoid of trees. At the northern end of the island, a **Peat Golem** digs fistfuls of peat from the earth. It carries the peat south, across a rickety bridge to Island 1, where it stacks the peat to dry. It repeats this sequence all day.

### 4. New Mine
* Patch of dense forest in the south, the rest of the island has been cleared of trees.
* At the south of the island a **Swamp Golem** pulls a tree out of the ground, carries it to the north of the island, and tosses it onto the dam structure. It repeats this sequence all day.
* To the north, a wide, low pile of trees and scrub torn out of the ground and tossed into the river by the golem. Lets significant amounts of water through but is beginning to have a noticeable effect on the water level in the swamp.
* Stepping stones to the east and south.

### 5. The Gas Farm
* In addition to the usual din of the swamp, close attention will reveal a faint bubbling sound from the east.
* Stepping stones to the west and south.
* Roll on the Land Encounters table.
* Hidden by the shore behind the trees to the east is a floating contraption consisting of hoses, valves and a large inflated sack, sewn and sealed with fat. It bubbles. The area stinks of farts. Hanging in nets from the trees are 2d6 gourds, filled with swamp gas, and sealed with wax.

### 6. The Forest
* Deep green and shaded.
* Bridges to the east and south. The bridges here are very old and made from stone.
* Roll on the Land Encounters table.

### 7. Druid's home
* Small mud hut, domed in shape. A chimney at the back spilling herbaceous smoke. Surrounded by pots, seedlings
* Home to Verna, the frogfolk druid.
* Candles, jars and containers full of seeds, herbs, and unknown ingredients. Bunches of herbs hang to dry from the ceiling.
* Everything is brown and green. The smell is a combination of damp leaves and cinnamon.

### 8. The Shrine
* Roll on the Land Encounters table.
* Ancient, non-human. A shallow pool of duckweed covered water with an arch and platform above.
* On the platform sits a frog-like humanoid stone idol. If smashed, a toxic mould is released that causes rapid fungification. If the idol is placed in the shrine pool, it dissolves and reveals an obsidian ring. The ring turns the wearer to stone until it is removed.

### 9. Forager's home
* Filthy tent in a clearing. Bedroll. Ring of stones surrounding a campfire. Fish is cooking over the fire. A handful of gourds in the process of being hollowed out. A pair of stilts.
* A tiny rowboat is moored near the tent.

### 10. Bargeman's island
* Ramshackle home on stilts.
