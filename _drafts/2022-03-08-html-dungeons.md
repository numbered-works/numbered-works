## Fixed Sidebar Menu

We like a fixed sidebar menu! It's handy to instantly jump to the information you need in the moment. Once they get long (like the menu in Swamp Renewal) the experience is not quite as elegant, especially on phones. We haven't found a solution that we like yet.

This is what we want our menu to do:
* At large screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet), the menu should be on the left of our content, and scroll independently if it's too long to fit on screen.
* At small screen sizes (phones), the menu should be invisible until the reader taps the menu button. The menu will appear over our main content. The menu should be scrollable, without scrolling the main content underneath it. When the reader taps an anchor link, the menu should close.
