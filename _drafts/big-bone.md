## Requirements
One referee, one or more players, pencil, paper, one giant foam d12 from Kmart, picnic blanket (optional).

## Game Structure
A referee describes a world to players who then describe how their characters act in that world. Together they create an adventure.

## Create a Character

2. Health Points are 6.
3. Distribute 3 points between these abilities:
   Strength: power, stamina, physical resilience.
   Dexterity: speed, agility, precision.
   Will: charisma, perception, willpower.

## Danger Roll
Whenever possible, a PC’s actions should be resolved by its player simply describing what the character does. When an action is risky, a player rolls 1d12 and adds the score from their relevant ability. If the total is 9 or more the action is successful. If not, the referee describes how it goes wrong. The roll result may indicate the degree of success or failure. A roll of 1 always has terrible results, regardless of modifiers. A roll of 12 is a fantastic success.

## Death
When a character’s Health Points reach zero, they die.

## Advancement
Level up every 2 picnics.

## Healing
Regain lost Health Points by eating a meal and getting a night of rest.
