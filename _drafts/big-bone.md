As well as individual items, PCs have rations and basic camping equipment. A PC can carry as many items as can fit in a backpack.

PCs with a *Spell* can generate one spell. It may be cast once. A new spell may be generated after one night of rest. A PC can only have one spell at a time. Spells will often have  chaotic results.

PCs with *+1 Attack* add 1 point to Attack Rolls.

## Danger

A PC’s actions should ideally be resolved by its player describing what the PC does. When an action is risky, a player rolls the dice and adds the score from their relevant Trait. If the total is more than the action's *Difficulty Score*, the action is successful.

## Difficulty Scores

* Easy: 7
* Medium: 9
* Hard: 11

## Combat

When one character attacks another, the attacker makes an *Attack Roll*. If the total exceeds the defender’s armour, the attack hits and deals damage equal to the difference between the two scores. Unarmed attacks deduct 1 point from this damage. Subtract the damage from the defender’s *Health Points*. If the defender has a shield they may choose to shatter it and ignore all damage from the attack.

## Health
Regain lost Health Points by getting one night of rest. When a PC’s Health Points reach zero, they die.
