### 4. Behind the Waterfall, a Cave
**Blackened walls, smell of smoke, moss**. Laying on the floor, The Rusted Knight, an **enchanted suit of armour**, too rusted to move. Hot to the touch, burns. Smoke escapes from helmet. Inside, a **wooden heart** floats, perpetually aflame. Suit will unsuccessfully attempt to move if players are sensed. Will not willingly pass through the waterfall or enter water. If it does so without protection, flame is extinguished. Can be repaired and made mobile with lubricant (oil, grease, wax) and cleaning. Will join the party if helped, and walk as if a man. Leaves a trail of glowing embers. Armed with sword and mace. Wants to find the queen.

A chest in the corner, emptied by earlier adventurers. A few scattered coins. A secret hatch in the lid holds a key

### 5. The Pond

Tranquil (Weeping willows, lily pads, birdsong). A pale, flickering apparition of a woman riding her horse in slow circles floats above the surface of the water. If the Rusted Knight sees the apparition, he will walk into the pond, extinguishing his flame, sinking to the depths below. Players who linger by the pond must make a WILL check or they too will be compelled to walk into the water.

Exploring the depths of the pool will reveal the skeletons of earlier adventurers. Deeper, the skeleton of the queen herself, wearing a gold crown  and fine jewels. Deeper still, her horse, shod with shoes of silver.

### 7. The Court
Large round table set with food. Fresh fruit, meats, breads, vegetables, desserts, on finely crafted platters. In reality the food is enchanted, and rotten (grey, furry, oozing, maggot-ridden). players must make a WILL save to see through the illusion. a STRENGTH check to save against illness if they eat.

The Wild King: Gaunt. Long hair and beard. Barefoot, ragged finery. Blind. Immune to the effects of apparitions and visual illusions.

The Twin Heirs: Ghouls. Grey. Competitive, wordless bickering. They HISS, fight over food. Chained together.


### 8. The Keep

The Mirror: covered in xxxxx.
shows a reflection of a differently aged self. if The Wild King passes the mirror his 25 year old self is revealed, but he does not see, and cannot cross the threshold. Players may see themselves refected as:
1. A week younger
2. Young adult
3. Teen
4. Child
5. Toddler
6. Infant


## Treasures table
1. A tattered ballroom gown. If a player wears it the king will ask them to dance. The king will smell the dress, deeply.
2. A copper crown. Anyone who wears it is protected from attack by ghouls, until they speak.
3. A set of pipes. Playing them skillfully will boil the listener's blood.

## Tree table
1. Rowan tree - carrying a stick from the tree protects against enchantment. Edible Red berries.
2. Oak tree - put an acorn in your pocket and restore health.
3. Hazelnut tree - hazelnuts protect against evil
